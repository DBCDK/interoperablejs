trivial/
    for browser implementations,
    using this directory as your path,
    load the "program" module.  It should
    alert you with the results of
    an increment function.

compliance/*
    for a module loader to be compliant,
    it must run and pass every test in
    this directory.

    All of these tests presume the existence of
    a "console" module that provides a "print"
    method for test reporting.  Tests call
    the "print" method with a "message"
    and a "label" argument that is one of
    "pass" or "fail".  "window.console.log"
    in most browsers suffices.

    All of these tests write a "DONE" info
    message to confirm that they ran completely.

security/*
    each directory here contains
    a test that verifies that a module
    can get capabilities from its environment
    without accessing free variables.

experiments/*
    each of these tests corresponds to
    an experimental feature, like
    "include" or implicit locally bound "exports".

global/*
    each directory here contains
    a program.html and a program.js.
    The program.html loads the transitive
    dependencies of program.js explicitly
    using script tags.  These tests 
    demonstrate compliant modules working
    in both <script> tags and module 
    loaders.
